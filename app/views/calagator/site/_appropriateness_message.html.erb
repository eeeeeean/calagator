USAGE: Display message describing appropriate content for this site

This message is shown on the "Add event" and "Import event(s)" pages. The appropriateness text is stored in a theme-specific partial and will only be displayed if found.

The theme-specific partial is retrieved from `themes/YOUR_THEME/views/site/_appropriateness`. You can find the `default` theme's appropriateness message partial at `themes/default/views/site/_appropriateness.html.erb` if you'd like to see an example.
